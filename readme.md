I have used json-server for api calls, To run json mock api kindly execute below command on the folder json-mock-api
    json-server --watch src/db.json

To run react pplication kindly execute below commands on the folder my-app, it will run on port 3006 as json server runs on 3000
    ->npm install
    ->npm start


Test can be executed by below command on my-app folder:
    ->npm test


I have used jest enzyme for running test.

I was not able to do custom Hook testing, due to time shortage.

Further components can be de-structured, to make them more independent.
